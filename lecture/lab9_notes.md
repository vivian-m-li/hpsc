- analyze the code for where threading might pay off
  - try that enhancement
- builds off of:
  - jacobi and CG solvers as input options
  - a nonlinearity with nonlinear iterations
  - more interesting problem for performance analysis
  - uses MPI but not threading... yet
- correctness verification: the plots have to match
